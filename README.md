# Data Analysis and Visualization

By Fengyuan Sun, Hugh Mee Wong, Marijn Alta & Sarah Tol.


- The /code folder contains the datasets and notebooks used for analysing and visualising the data.
- The /docs folder contains the files used for the website that has been used for the demo.
- technical_rapport_group_5.pdf contains the technical rapport.
- process_book.pdf contains the process book.
- logbook.pdf contains the logbook.

### Notes
- The gunownership.csv file contains data about registered guns per state and per capita. gun_ownership.csv is the less polished version, but has been used for previous plots and therefore will not be removed.
